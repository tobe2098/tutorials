# Controlling battery thresholds
The trick is in setting the BIOS to a threshold that the battery is below of, for the charging to follow the restrictions. In my case I installed Windows even, used all available tools, in the end it did not work until I got the battery low enough to be below threshold. Sadly the battery will just stay at that level, no bouncing between thresholds.
